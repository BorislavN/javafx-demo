Hello.
Here I will create JavaFx GUI for my chat implementations.

SocketChannel implementation - https://github.com/BorislavN/java-advanced/tree/main/src/chat_app

DatagramChannel implementation - https://github.com/BorislavN/java-advanced/tree/main/src/multicast_chat_app

The chat in the "multicast" module features only a "Settings" page (to select "host" and "port") and a common chat lobby.

The chat in the "unicast" module features the "Settings" page, the common lobby and a "Private Messages" page.
